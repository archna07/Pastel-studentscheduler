# 🎨 Pastel Student Scheduler

## 📘 Introduction
The **Pastel Student Scheduler** is a full-stack Python desktop application designed to help students structure their study sessions, manage time efficiently, and stay focused.  
It combines proven productivity techniques—like the **Pomodoro Technique** and **time-boxing**—with real-time timers, automatic break scheduling, and visual analytics.

The app’s pastel-themed, minimal design creates a calm environment, helping students manage workloads without stress. It supports both **planning** and **execution** phases of study, turning abstract productivity theories into a hands-on, supportive tool.

## 🎯 Project Objectives
The project was developed with the following key goals:

- **Implement Time-Boxing and Flow Scheduling:**  
  Allow users to define study sessions and built-in breaks (e.g., Water/Food). The app calculates accurate start and end times, creating a realistic daily flow.

- **Provide Real-Time Focus Tools (Timer & Alarms):**  
  Includes a background multi-threaded timer system that runs independently, helping users focus and automatically alerting them when sessions end.

- **Generate Study Analytics:**  
  Dynamically visualize schedules using **Matplotlib**, with:
  - A **Time Distribution Pie Chart**
  - A **Daily Schedule (Bar Chart)**

- **Enhance Motivation & Accountability:**  
  Display motivational quotes and a visible progress bar that tracks total committed time against a daily study goal.

- **Modern GUI Design:**  
  Use **Tkinter** to build a clean, responsive, pastel-themed interface that promotes calm focus and sustained use.

## ⚙️ Input and Output Discussion

### 🧾 Input
Users interact with the system through Tkinter input fields and buttons in two main sections — **Input Frame** and **Timer & Alarms**.

1. **Session Details (for Schedule):**
   - **Subject/Task:** e.g., *"Organic Chemistry"*, *"Practice Coding"*
   - **Duration (min):** e.g., 45, 90
   - **Priority:** High / Medium / Low

2. **Break Triggers (Predefined):**
   - *Water Break:* 5 minutes  
   - *Food Break:* 30 minutes

3. **Timer Input:**
   - Separate **focus timer** in minutes for single study sessions.

---

### 🧩 Output
The system provides real-time and historical feedback in several forms:

1. **Scheduled Output (Treeview):**
   - A live-updated schedule table with:
     - Start Time
     - Task Name
     - Duration
     - Priority
   - Automatically appends new tasks after existing ones to create a continuous flow.

2. **Visualization Output (Matplotlib):**
   - **Time Distribution Pie Chart:**  
     Displays proportions of Study, Water Break, and Food Break.
   - **Daily Schedule Bar Chart (Gantt-style):**  
     Shows the full-day timeline for all tasks.

3. **Real-Time & Motivational Output:**
   - **Timer Display:** Shows countdown for focus sessions.
   - **Progress Bar:** Tracks total study time vs. target goal (6 hours).
   - **Motivational Quotes:** Randomly displayed to encourage consistency.

## 🧠 Technologies Used

| Technology | Role / Application |
|-------------|--------------------|
| **Tkinter** | GUI framework for building the main interface (frames, buttons, tables). |
| **Matplotlib** | Data visualization for pie charts and bar charts integrated directly into the GUI. |
| **NumPy** | (Optional) For handling numerical operations and statistical extensions in future versions. |
| **Threading** | Enables concurrent timer operations without freezing the GUI. |
| **datetime** | Handles scheduling logic — calculates start and end times for tasks and breaks. |
